# Google Data Analytics: Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study
## Introduction
The Cyclistic case study is one of the two capstone projects available in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone).

In this documentation, we will go through the following data analysis phases: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. If you want to skip directly to the data visualisations, you can go to: [Cyclistic Case Study Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sophie.pages/viz/GoogleDataAnalyticsDashboardofCyclisticcasestudy/Dashboard3).

## Case study description
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. In this project, I will take the role of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analytics team.

### Company
Cyclistic launched in 2016 a successful bike-share offering with over 5,800 bicycles and 690 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be taken from one station and returned to any other station in the system.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on growing its customers by building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. 

Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders select the traditional bikes and about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Cyclistic popularity can also be attributed to the flexibility of its pricing plans: customers can choose between single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while customers who purchase annual memberships are called annual members.

To understand the flexibility in pricing, we can take a look at the difference in pricing for classic bikes: 
* Single rides have an initial cost of $1 to unlock the bike and then $0.18 per minute. 
* Day passes have the first 3 hours for free and then $0.18 per minute. 
* Annual memberships have the first 45 minutes for free and then $0.18 per minute.

### Change in marketing strategy
Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract customers, Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. 

The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that the company’s future success depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 

Lily Moreno has set a clear goal to the marketing analytics team: to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, and they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Before making recommendations, the marketing analytics team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The Cyclistic historical bike trip data will be analysed to identify trends.
